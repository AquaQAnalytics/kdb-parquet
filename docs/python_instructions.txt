there are several python files that can be used to read and write parquet files

1. create_parquet_demo.py

kdb-Apache/Python/create_parquet_demo.py creates a simple parquet file based on the pandas dataframe in the file:

df = pd.DataFrame({'one': [1,2,3],
                   'two': ['a', 'b', 'c'],
                   'three': [True, False, True]},
                   index=list('abc'))

this dataframe can be modified as required and the extra fields added to the 
fields variable list using the pyarrow datatypes found at https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/api/datatypes.html

to create the parquet file using this python file simply run this file with the name of the parquet file you would like to be created at the command line:
python create_parquet_demo.py	example.parquet

2. read_parquet_demo.py
kdb-Apache/Python/read_parquet_demo.py
enter the parquet file that you wish to read in as a command line paramater
read_parquet_demo.py example.parquet

3. write.p
kdb-apache/tests/testdata/write.p

4. read.q
kdb-apache/tests/testdata/read.q
